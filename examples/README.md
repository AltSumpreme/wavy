# Examples for Wavy

Wavy has a lot of libraries that it are aimed to be neat wrappers around **Boost**, **libav\***, **TOML++** so on.

These wrapper APIs are pretty powerful and are used throughout the Wavy project. Understanding them can be a bit tricky at first glance.

By looking into these examples, it should be more clear how the project works on a better level.

Each example is an isolated file that only performs one *major* task that directly fetches class and methods from `include/` directory of the Wavy project.
