This library contains the logic and implementation of Wavy's future adaptive bitrate (ABR) streaming for audio.

The theory and implementation are still very much still in the "drawing-board" phase and a lot things still need to be thought over
and ironed out before the overhaul

Currently existing code is a very naive and simple minded implementation that is **NOT** integrated with the rest of the project
